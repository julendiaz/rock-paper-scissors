# Rock Paper Scissors Game - The Odin Project

## Brief Introduction

In this project, we are going to build from scratch the implementation for the Old-School game Rock Paper Scissors. This is a really nice and introductory way of applying the widespread system of thinking as a programmer.

Regarding the purpose of the exercise, I went for using the already designed UI from Front-End Mentor Challenge so I could focus on trying to come up with a clean solution in the javascript file.

## Goals of the Project

- [ ] Make the game Rock Paper Scissors work
- [ ] Implement the "Think like a Programmer" system
- [ ] Come up with at least two different solutions for the problem
- [ ] Implement the UI from Front-End Mentor
- [ ] Have fun
